## Welcome to my SRE Journey

I wanted to create this Github pages in order to make honour to one of the principles an SRE should take in consideration seriously, which is **document** their work. But, first of all, let me introduce myself:

Hi, my name is Juan Manuel Canals, but better call me Juanma :) If I am honest, I started my SRE journey 2 years ago, when I got into IBM in an SRE graduate program. I entered the program the same month I finished my University Degree in Telecom, and from that moment until now I have been learning different technologies working all around different departments for the same client, one of the biggest banks here in Spain. I consider that I have learned a lot mainly because of the colleagues with whom I have been working with, but I want to try new things. I want to deploy and destroy, build my own server, deploy services and monitor their performance, try to attack them, recover from those attacks... I just wanna have fun. 

So, that is the goal of this repo, to have fun. Hope that the work I do could be used by more people.

Thank you!
